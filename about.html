On a bright and sunny day at the zoo, everything was going well. All the animals were having fun, while the tourists were enjoying them, but that night something would happen that would change all their lives. The elephants went wild and broke out of their sanctuaries as they attacked throughout the zoo and freed most of the animals. Tigers, camels, and snakes were all freed as the zoo and surrounding areas got trashed, but there were some saviors that were unexpected. All of our famous exotic birds broke out and protected the zoo as they fought off all the reckless animals. They saved our lives and many others, but we cannot afford to keep them now. We want yall to have someone that can protect you as these birds are cool, unique, and protective. Buy a Bird Today! - The Biggest Birds a company founded by Carter Noble, Chase Vowell, and Jackson Greer.</h5></p>
